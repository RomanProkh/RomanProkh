<h1>Hi, I'm Roman!üëã</h1>
<h3> I'm a software engineer based in Finland, currently working at the Finnish Food Authority (Ruokavirasto) as a Test Automation Engineer, ensuring the reliability of critical digital services used by other public authorities. <br> <br>
I also work at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences, where I design and develop complete online courses ‚Äî from planning the structure to creating content, exercises, and implementing everything in Moodle. <br> <br>
Most of my current work is not open-source, but I hope to share selected tools, examples, or educational materials here in the future. <br> <br>
Thanks for visiting! üõ†Ô∏èüìö <br /> </h3>
